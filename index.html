    <h1>Winter Love</h1>
    
    <p>I would like to decorate this silence, <br>
    but my house grows only cleaner <br> 
    and more plain. The glass chimes I hung <br>
    over the register ring a little <br>
    when the heat goes on. <br>
    I waited too long to drink my tea. <br>
    It was not hot. It was only warm.
